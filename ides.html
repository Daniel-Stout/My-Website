    <h3><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a></h3>
    <p>IntelliJ IDEA, the premier Java IDE in terms of both features and price, comes in two editions: the free Community edition, and the paid Ultimate edition, which has additional features.</p>
    <p>The Community edition is intended for JVM and Android development. It supports Java, Kotlin, Groovy, and Scala; Android; Maven, Gradle, and SBT; and Git, SVN, Mercurial, CVS, and TFS.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a></h3>
    <p>Eclipse, long the most popular Java IDE, is free and open source and is written mostly in Java, although its plugin architecture allows Eclipse to be extended in other languages. Eclipse originated in 2001 as an IBM project to replace the Smalltalk-based IBM Visual Age family of IDEs with a portable Java-based IDE. A goal of the project was to eclipse Microsoft Visual Studio, hence the name.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://www.bluej.org/">BlueJ</a></h3>
    <p>BlueJ is a free Java development environment designed for beginners at Kings College London. It is supported by Oracle. BlueJ has a deliberately smaller and simpler interface than professional environments like NetBeans or Eclipse, and there is an introductory college textbook about learning OOP with BlueJ.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/">NetBeans</a></h3>
    <p>The NetBeans Java IDE started life as a university student project in Prague in 1996, became a commercial product in 1997, was bought by Sun in 1999, and was released to open source in 2000. It was recently donated to Apache, and has been accepted as an incubating project.</p>
    <p>Oracle is turning over the code in chunks; the initial drop was only the Java SE portion of the code. You need to use the 8.2 libraries to get the other plugins you may be used to having. The turmoil in NetBeans land during the hand-off may explain why NetBeans 9 doesn't yet support JUnit 5: at this point that integration is only in the outline phase.</p>
